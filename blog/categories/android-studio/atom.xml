    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I started developing for the Android platform in earnest around April of
2013.  I found that the Android project had release not just a mere plugin for
Eclipse but a rebranded, pre-customized version of Eclipse called ADT or
Android Development Toolkit.</p>

<p>This seemed pretty cool, I guess, though it seems better to just release a
plugin so you can slice and dice your dev environment however you want.</p>

<h2>Cool, but can it do Vim?</h2>

<p>At least for the February release of ADT it did not work so well (the 20130219
version)-- installing vrapper breaks all kinds of things:</p>

<p>This:</p>

<p>Turned in to this:</p>

<p>Afterwards, all of my Android integration pre-packaged in ADT seemed to
disappear.  I had to manually re-install the Android integration that was
previously there.  Not sure why I did... maybe it was user error... but it was
not a good user experience.</p>

<h2>Alternate Reality: Android Studio</h2>

<p>So far, my experience with trying the Android Studio preview has been great,
but mostly because the of the dark UI, super easy <em>vim installation</em> that didn't
<em>nuke any Android integration</em> ... and because it does stuff like this:</p>

<p>Finally, something that can at least make Java not look so stupid.  To quote
the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/10/campaign.lipstick/">Sarah Palin jibe</a>, <em>"it's just lipstick on a pig"</em>, but I'll take
it!  Yes sir, uh-huh.</p>

<hr />

<p>So... this brings me to new version of ADT (verstion 20130522) -- I'm starting
a new project I figured I'd try to upgrade to the May release of ADT.  Lo and
behold it doesn't come pre-packaged with something called <em>Android Build Tools</em>
and it has a really shitty way to install it, basically it pops up a nag box
and says:</p>

<p>```
Hey, we couldn't take the time to implement auto download or to auto package
this new tool we're requiring, so go grab it yourself, good luck!</p>

<p>Yours truly,
-Asshats
```</p>

<p>This wasted a good hour as I groped around trying to figure out what was wrong.
Finally the Internet saved me as I discovered that many other developers can't
read either:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/885009/r-cannot-be-resolved-android-error">R cannot be resolved</a> [Stack Overflow]</li>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/android-developers/rCaeT3qckoE">Some else with the R problem</a> [Google Groups]</li>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/adt-dev/epOfZbKPFdk">Another person, same problem</a> [Google Groups]</li>
</ul>


<p>The thing is, I did read the nag dialog, and I tried to download whatever it
wanted, but for whatever reason (poor up bringing -- loose morals -- just plain
dumb) I didn't succeed.  So, this proves at least one thing: <em>Android
developers can't read</em>.  Or does it?  Maybe it proves that Google wasted a lot
of people's time with this decision.</p>
