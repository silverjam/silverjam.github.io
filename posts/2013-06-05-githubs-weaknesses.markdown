# GitHub is great

## Free Hosting + A Nice Interface

## But... Private Hosting Is Expensive

# GitHub Pull Requests = Messy History

Non-linear history

Make bisect harder

## Tracking code origin

How would you do this otherwise?

# A better workflow

git request-pull

## Must have remote

# The ultimate solution (reviews + continous integration)

Gerrit

<!-- vim: spell:
