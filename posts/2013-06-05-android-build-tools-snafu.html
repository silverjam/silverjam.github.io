         <p>So, I started developing for the Android platform in earnest around April of 
            2013.  I found that the Android project had release not just a mere plugin for 
            Eclipse but a rebranded, pre-customized version of Eclipse called ADT or 
            Android Development Toolkit.
         </p>
         <p>This seemed pretty cool, I guess, though it seems better to just release a 
            plugin so you can slice and dice your dev environment however you want.
         </p>
         <h2>Cool, but can it do Vim?</h2>
         <p>At least for the February release of ADT it did not work so well (the 20130219 
            version)-- installing vrapper breaks all kinds of things:
         </p>
         <p>This:</p><img src=../images/adt-splash-screen-1.png />
         
         <p>Turned in to this:</p><img src=../images/juno-splash-screen.png />
         
         <p>Afterwards, all of my Android integration pre-packaged in ADT seemed to 
            disappear.  I had to manually re-install the Android integration that was 
            previously there.  Not sure why I did... maybe it was user error... but it was 
            not a good user experience.
         </p>
         <h2>Alternate Reality: Android Studio</h2>
         <p>So far, my experience with trying the Android Studio preview has been great, 
            but mostly because the of the dark UI, super easy <em>vim installation</em> that didn't 
            <em>nuke any Android integration</em> ... and because it does stuff like this:
         </p><img src=../images/astudio-closure-fold.png />
         
         <p>Finally, something that can at least make Java not look so stupid.  To quote 
            the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/10/campaign.lipstick/">Sarah Palin jibe</a>, <em>"it's just lipstick on a pig"</em>, but I'll take 
            it!  Yes sir, uh-huh.
         </p>
         <article>
            <p>So... this brings me to new version of ADT (version 20130522) -- I'm starting 
               a new project I figured I'd try to upgrade to the May release of ADT.  Lo and 
               behold it doesn't come pre-packaged with something called <em>Android Build Tools</em> 
               and it has a really shitty way to install it, basically it pops up a nag box 
               and says:
            </p><pre><code class="language-plaintext">Hey, we couldn't take the time to implement auto download or to auto package
this new tool we're requiring, so go grab it yourself, good luck!

Yours truly,
-Asshats
</code></pre><p>This wasted a good hour as I groped around trying to figure out what was wrong. 
               Finally the Internet saved me as I discovered that many other developers can't 
               read either:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/885009/r-cannot-be-resolved-android-error">R cannot be resolved</a> [Stack Overflow]
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/android-developers/rCaeT3qckoE">Some else with the R problem</a> [Google Groups]
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/adt-dev/epOfZbKPFdk">Another person, same problem</a> [Google Groups]
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The thing is, I did read the nag dialog, and I tried to download whatever it 
               wanted, but for whatever reason (poor up bringing -- loose morals -- just plain 
               dumb) I didn't succeed.  So, this proves at least one thing: <em>Android 
                  developers can't read</em>.  Or does it?  Maybe it proves that Google wasted a lot 
               of people's time with this decision.
