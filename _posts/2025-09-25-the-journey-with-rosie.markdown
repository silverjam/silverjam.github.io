*SUMMARY:  A story about growing up with dogs, grief, loss and healing.*

## First meeting Rosie

Rosie was a German Shepard and Australian Shepard mix.  I first saw her at a PetSmart in Albuquerque, New Mexico -- I don't remember why we were there, but as one does you play with the puppies when they have an adoption event at the store and then happenstance leaves you with a new family member...

This story of a "chance" encounter  with  the adoption event and happening to see Rosie fits with my romantic notion around the adoption of a new pet... that is, sometimes serendipity brings you together, things click into place, and fate sends you a new companion that you were meant to be with...  Not all of our pets have come to us this way, but Rosie's impact on my life was a large, deep, and such that it hopefully won't fade any time soon.

So, it seems fitting that fate chanced a meeting between us.

## Growing up with dogs

To better understand the journey it's helpful to talk a little bit about how I grew up... I've always grown up around dogs and being an only child, dogs were occasionally the only other soul that was around. I was born in small oil town in New Mexico where we had a few dogs that I barely remember. However, the first dog I really remember was Tiger, he was a brindle striped Terrier that was already pretty old when I was younger.  He passed at an old age when I was at school, and we buried him in the foothills of the Albuquerque mountains-- where he loved to go on hikes. Tiger's passing hurt, but I don't remember it being all that lasting.  I remember being upset, and wanting to express my rage with my father by literally screaming at the sky after we laid him to rest, but whatever I felt passed pretty quickly.

The next dogs growing up where Bradford and Silver-- Silver was a birthday present, adopted when I was about 10 years old from a random litter somewhere outside of Albuquerque.  Silver was the first dog were I had a large part in his upbringing and his care.  I have a vivid memory of potty training Silver when he was an barely an 8 week old puppy, and I was a kid, but I remember waking up in the middle of the night and wondering where he was, only to wander out into the hallway of the house and find him about to go "number 2" on the carpet.  I ran to grab him and whisked him outside to (hopefully) reinforce his potty training.

Despite this though I was still just a kid who was occasionally a shithead, and as a kid I was not always as kind to our dogs as I should have been.  Sometimes I found titillation in antagonizing them and while I never did anything that would harm them, it's still not something I'm proud of today.  This is important though, because it was a motivation behind a desire to do better as an adult.  At some point when I was growing up I decided that when I adopted a dog as an adult, I was going to make sure that dog lived the best life I could give them.

## Rosie was my own

And so, Rosie was the first dog that was really *mine*.  When we adopted her I was a few years into my first real job, we lived in an apartment, but it was an otherwise ideal time when I had the money and the time to raise and train a dog properly.  I could set right all the things right that went wrong when I was younger.  I was the "architect" of Rosie's training, upbringing and care.

Despite my desires to engineer the perfect dog, Rosie was her own dog with her own desires and unique challenges.  She was intelligent, strong willed and proud, all of which made life with her rewarding and challenging in ways that I didn't expect.

In many ways, she was my first "child" -- I not found of the term "fur baby" but at times it does aptly describe the responsibilities of a pet owner around the upbringing, care, and feeding of another life.  I know for certain that some of my parenting style is derived from my experience with raising dogs... (perhaps a bit unfortunate for my human children).

## A dog is a dog, but also... family

Following on that note, I believe that things like animals and people have a certain essential nature.  That means there's core behaviors and characteristics that don't (or can't) change, and being aware of them helps build a better understanding.  So, terms like fur-baby just seem to anthropomorphize dogs in a way that hides or ignores their true nature.

Even if you have this understanding (or distance) that doesn't stop a deep bond from forming.  I've mused on how odd it is that this bond is reserved for a small subset of animals in Western society, and other animals are treated with either indifference or cruelty.  The practice shows how malleable our compassion is, but it also shows its deference towards utility and mutual benefit.  But I digress...

The utility that existed between myself, Rosie and the family had many facets.  For example, we did lots of training at a training facility in Albuquerque called ACOMA.  This facility taught me a lot about how to train and raise dogs.  ACOMA emphasized the use of positive and negative reinforcement.  For dogs that responded to just positive enforcement, that was all that was used, but for most dogs and combination of positive and negative reinforcement was needed.  ACOMA also taught me about the limits of dogs with respect to how they learn and how to recognize when a dog's ability to learn was "saturated".

Overall I think these experiences helped to provide structure around how our relationship developed.  Like many things in life, developing a deeper understanding for how something works can often make for a richer and more empathetic experience.  Of course I didn't always live up to this day to day, but hopefully we were better off for it in the long run.

## Snapshots of Rosie's life

### Agility training

### Attack by loose dogs

<figcaption>
Rosie was attacked by some loose dogs in our neighborhood in Albuquerque, I was able to scare off the dogs by screaming like a deranged lunatic, I'm glad this worked, but was definitely a scenario that could've turned out differently if the dogs hadn't been scared (a realization I had only in hindsight).

### Hiking & coyotes

<figure>
<img src="../images/3338096711_4798f5733f_o (1).jpg" />
<figcaption>
Like most dogs, Rosie loved hiking, both in New Mexico and in California.  One of the few times I heard Rosie express fear was when we were hiking in California early in the morning and we had a few coyotes start to follow us, luckily they weren't interested in us for very long and eventually went their own way.

### Coming to California

<figure>

<figcaption>
Rosie came with us to California when I got my first job here with her dog sibling Nell, she adapted well to life here, but our living situation forced us to send Nell to live with my parents.  A few years later we moved into a house where we could have more dogs again, but by that time Nell had fully integrated into my parents house, so she stayed in New Mexico.  So, Rosie was our lone dog for a while with our two cats.

### Getting old(er)

<figure>

<figcaption>
After coming to California, I really struggled to find a vet that I liked, most of the vets in our area seemed accustomed to serving more affluent clientele, and it showed in their practices and pricing.  We eventually found a good vet in Livermore, but it meant a fair amount of driving just to go to the vet.  The drive is routine now, but I remember coming back from a vet visit after learning that Rosie was diagnosed with Cushing Disease and suddenly realizing that this was beginning of the end of my time with her.  It was still some 5 years before she would pass, but it hit really hard at that time.

### Adopting Ariel

<figure>
<img src="../images/IMG_9858.jpg" />
<figcaption>
We adopted Ariel as a reward for my older daughter doing well in school and hopefully as something that would teach her some responsibility... she did well in school but didn't end up doing much to raise and train Ariel...  Ariel, being who she is, was enamored with Rosie, and it was unfortunate that we adopted her so late in Rosie's life because they never got to bond much.  I know Rosie cared for Ariel, but Rosie was an old lady, and her treatment of her definitely showed that-- she wasn't (usually) mean, but definitely not as friendly as she could've been 😅 ~

### Emergency vet

<figure>

<figcaption>
All things considered, Rosie's diagnosis with Cushings Disease ended up not being the death knell that I thought it was since we were able to manage her symptoms with medication for a long time.  The real decline seemed to start when she forgot that she was old and decided to jump out of the car and tore a ligament in her back knee.  I'd been using a ramp for her for a few years to get in and out of the car, but despite her experience with dog agility, she still wanted to believe that she could jump in and out herself.  The weakness in her back legs betray her though and she ended up with a tear in her knee joint.  Though unrelated to the Cushings this event marked the beginning of a decline which ended with an "attack" one night that looked a lot like a seizure.  After visiting the doctor, we learned that her Cushings had advanced significantly, at which point she largely stopped eating and drinking, and was no longer able to walk around without a lot of assistance.

## Passing

I don't have many regrets with respect to Rosie's life.  There are certainly things I wish I'd done differently, in particular I probably should have arranged better care for her when she was old.  There were a few scenarios where we had to leave her at home when she was old that probably would've been better handled by hiring professional care (or enlisting the help of a trusted friend), even for short stints.  She ended up being fine in those scenarios, but it was definitely a roll of the dice I probably shouldn't have taken.

Rosie's passing started me down a path that I didn't know was going to be so hard, or take so long.  I've been fortunate in my life to not have to directly deal with much loss.  I've experienced it incidentally, and supported others through loss, but Rosie was a lesson in directly dealing with loss I don't think I was prepared for... for instance, I've heard in stories and discussions with people about literally "wanting to go back in time", about not wanting to live in your present reality anymore because the person (or dog) that you love is no longer there.  I experienced this viscerally with Rosie.

Then the pain of that loss become itself something I wanted to live inside because it felt like the only thing I had left of her.  I felt like as long as I was in pain that I still cared, and I didn't want to not be in pain and then feel like I didn't care for her anymore.  This manifested in scenarios which (in hindsight) where silly where I was desperately looking for some of Rosie's hair around the house after she had passed because I wanted a way to be reminded of what she felt and smelled like (and I had forgotten to ask the doctor to preserve a clipping when we took to have her put to sleep).  There was rich irony in that scenario, since I spent most of her life being annoyed by all the hair, but there I was after the end of her life, only wanting to find some of it to keep as a memento.

The pain subsided, and Ariel and I gradually got used to our new normal without Rosie.  The day-to-day with Ariel was easy, Ariel's only real challenge was her allergies and her penchant for wanting to sleep under the covers and right next to you.  This new normal was slow and easy, which was definitely what I needed for a while.

## Lessons

Perhaps a practical lesson I experienced was learning how to rationalize or think about the financing of care for older pets.  Older pets can be expensive and that can build regret around the amount of time you were able to give them or around your ability to pay for their care, but you also have to weigh that against the richness of the life they lived.

That's not to say that you shouldn't spend what you can on making sure your pet gets as many good years as they can, but that at a certain point there's diminishing returns for ever increasing costs (this was especially the case when discussing Rosie's final prognosis with the emergency vet).  These diminishing returns are coupled with the fact that there's mercy in the end of suffering, as much as it will hurt you, it's also one final gift you can give to them...  also, I recognize that I speak about this from a place of privilege, but I hope I would still be able to see that I did what I could even if I couldn't afford vet care.

Another lesson is perhaps that experiencing and learning about grief can come from relationships where you might not expect it.  I knew Rosie was important, but the surprise was learning just how deeply important she was after she was gone.  Which serves as a reminder to enjoy and cherish the time that you have, making sure that you respect the essential nature of a relationship for what it is and are aware of its limitations.

## Grief and acceptance

Fast forward to about a year and a half later and I received an email from a small dog boarding business that we'd used previously, this was a small business run out of a house in Castro Valley, California sharing that a client of theirs had a foster puppy up for adoption.  I was struck by how much this dog reminded me of Rosie.  My romantic notions around pet adoption kicked in and I felt I had to reach out.

Compounding this situation I started to entertain the idea that maybe this *was* Rosie, reincarnated and trying to make her way back to me.  I felt compelled to reach out, even though it really wasn't a good time for us to entertain taking on a new pet.  We happened to be preparing to leave for a big trip to Hawaii and we would've had a terrible time trying to figure out how to board a brand new dog.  We decided to go a bit spur of the moment, so my older daughter didn't attend.

The dog's name was Nia, and our first meeting... did not go well, despite my exceptionally romantic notions of the situation, reality showed me that Nia was her own entity, with a unique set of quirks and challenges.  In Nia's case, she had a pretty large dose of stranger danger, and overall did not really demonstrate much interest in us or Ariel.  Ariel and Nia played a bit, but it didn't help that Ariel was also stressed from being in Oakland (Ariel is sound sensitive and very much a pandemic dog, so she never had much of a chance to acclimate to noisy city environments).

Given that the meeting didn't go well, and our impending travel, I just decided to say no, and hoped that Nia would find a good family in the interim.  Someone that understood shepherds and could give her the time and space she needed.  This for me really seemed to complete the cycle of grief, where I finally accepted that Rosie was gone, that this new dog wasn't her, and that I need to move forward.

## Healing and moving forward

</figure>

After I said no, we went on our trip to Hawaii and had a great time.  It was wonderfully relaxing and was our last big family vacation before my daughter went off to college in the fall.  However, as it turns out, there are not many people, even in the Bay Area, that want to take on a dog with stranger danger.  People want puppies, or they want dogs that are easy, or at least dogs that are going to show affection pretty quickly.  But as I would learn, shy dogs have a lot to offer too, it just takes a bit of time to gain their trust and build up a healthy relationship.

Our second meeting with Nia came after I saw from her foster's Instagram that she was still up for adoption two months later.  Her foster reached out to us and asked if we'd be willing to meet Nia again.  We decided to have another meeting and this time the whole family went.  To say things went better was an understatement.  Nia was still scared of me and my wife, but she immediately bonded with my younger daughter, and took pretty well to my older daughter.  So we decided to give her a chance, since she would at least get along with one person in the family.

Nia took time and effort, it was a full week before she was remotely acclimated to me.  She was much quicker with my daughters and my wife... I had to be careful not to engage with her until she was ready.  Over time, she learned that I wasn't a threat and she learned to trust me.  To be honest, I wasn't fully ready to move on, Ariel and I had settled into life without Rosie, and I was afraid of the complications that new dog would bring to the relative stability of our life.  My wife helped me move past this trepidation and fully commit to giving Nia a chance to integrate into the family.

I'm glad my wife helped me get past my fear, because I could not be more in love with Nia.  Wishing that she would be just another Rosie was really selling short the experience of living with this new dog.  Nia couldn't be more different than Rosie, there's plenty of behaviors and tendencies that are common to all German Shepherds, but she's a super affectionate, goofy and happy ball of fluff that's hard to be mad at when she does something bad.  As our relationship has improved it's hard to express how much I enjoy having her in our life.

## Final thoughts

TBD

## Notes

- Looking for fur afterwards
- Loss doesn't every seem to go away // Dread at wanting to go back in time
- Owning an old pet isn't easy -- guilt over being frustrated when caring for them
- Going to see Taylor Swift, should have booked a house sitter
- Healing, mourning and grieving process that finalized with the adoption of Nia.
