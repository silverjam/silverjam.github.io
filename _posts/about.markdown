*SUMMARY: About Jason Mobarak and this blog.*

## About This Blog

This blog is built using a custom static site generator that transforms Markdown posts into HTML using XSLT. The goal is to create something simple and durable that will work "FOREVER" using standard, stable technologies.

## About Me

I'm Jason Mobarak, a software engineer interested in build systems, developer tools, and creating robust, long-lasting software solutions.

## Technical Details

This site uses:
- **Markdown** for content authoring
- **CommonMark XML** as an intermediate format
- **XSLT** for HTML transformation
- **Pico.css** for styling
- **highlight.js** for syntax highlighting

The entire build process is managed by a simple Makefile, ensuring reproducible builds and minimal dependencies.
